# MEAN Mobile Seed

A starting project for your next hackathon project or mobile app. Handles all the configuration and boilerplate for you so that you can start building what makes your app unique!

Mobile client is built with the Ionic mobile framework, based on AngularJS. Backend is a Node/Express API backed by MongoDB with Mongoose.

This seed project handles user signin/signup with secure encryption for password storage, basic routing and navigation, and user account settings. I've tried to document everything as well as possible to make it easier to add functionality. 

First step is installing and configuring the different packages. Get started by following the directions below.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:


```bash
$ npm install && bower install
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
